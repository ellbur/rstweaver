class WeaverLanguage(object):
    '''
    Extend this class to create a Weaver language.
    
    Pass to the constructor a dict with some subset of the following keys:
        -- WeaverLanguage.noninteractive
        -- WeaverLanguage.interactive
        -- WeaverLanguage.session
    
    The values of the dict should be the reST directive names associated with
    those modes. So for example for Haskell you could do:
        WeaverLanguage.__init__(self, {
            WeaverLanguage.noninteractive: 'haskell',
            WeaverLanguage.interactive:    'ghci'
        })
    
    Look at the methods defined by this class to see what you should implement.
    Some methods are only required to support one mode (noninteractive or
    interactive).

        This should test compilation of the source file and report any errors.

        This should run several lines of input in interactive mode, and return
        output as a list of the same length.
        
        It may also get passed a list of files to "import" (whatever that means
        for this language) before running the line.
        
        Should the interactive interpreter have "memory"? unfortunately right
        now that's kind of up to you. It would probably be nice, though it's
        hard to implement for some languages. Whatever you want.
        
        You will probably find self.chopped_interactive() helpful.

        Parameters:
            lines   -- List of strings of source code
            imports -- List of files (relative paths) to "import"
            wd      -- Working directory for interpreter.

        '''
        Run an interactive session by a hacky uuid-chopping method.
        
        The issue this is trying to solve is that most interactive interpreters
        operate on streams of text, not transactions, so it is tricky to tell
        which line of output corresponds to which line of input. The solution
        is a sesson like the following:
        
        > 'aa2252eaf'
        'aa2252eaf
        > 2 + 2
        4
        > '2214e4fac'
        '2214e4fac'
        
        Where those obnoxious hex strings act like delimiters.
        
        You provide the following information:
            lines  - The lines of input to run
            put_id - A function taking a string and making a "print statement"
              out of it
            get_id - A function taking a string and producing what the output
              of the "print statement" will look like.
            preamble - Any text to feed to the interpreter before the start of
              the session.
            wrap_line - A function taking a line of user-supplied input, and
              producing the text that will be sent to the interpreter.
            command - command to sent to Popen (so command + args as a list)
            wd - Working directory path.
        
        And this will return the corresponding output lines.
